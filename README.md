# 🚦 Smart Traffic Light Controller (Verilog)

A *Verilog-based Smart Traffic Light Controller* designed using FSM (Finite State Machine) architecture. It simulates intelligent traffic handling based on *car detection, **emergency override, and **queue management. Designed for **simulation using Icarus Verilog* and *waveform visualization using GTKWave*.

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ *Car/pedestrian detection* via car_detected input  
- 🚨 *Emergency override* logic using emergency signal  
- 🧠 FSM-based traffic light control with intelligent timing  
- 📈 *Queue simulation* through queue_count signal  
- 🔁 Covers *normal, emergency, and queue scenarios*  
- 💬 Well-commented and modular Verilog code

## 🔄 FSM Overview

### 🧠 States and Transitions

| *State*      | *Description*                                                         | *Transition Condition*                                |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| RED          | Default state. All vehicles must stop. System waits for a car or emergency trigger.     | After 5 clock cycles → RED_YELLOW                      |
| RED_YELLOW   | Prepares traffic to move by warning.                                     | If queue_count > 0 → GREEN, else → RED             |
| GREEN        | Vehicles pass. Queue is reduced.                                         | After 3–6 clock cycles (based on queue) → YELLOW       |
| YELLOW       | Prepares vehicles to stop.                                               | After 2 clock cycles → RED                             |
| EMERGENCY    | Overrides normal flow. All lights go RED for emergency clearance.        | When emergency == 0 → RED                            |

### 🔁 Transition Logic

- *Emergency* has highest priority and forces transition to EMERGENCY.
- *Queue Timing*:
  - If queue_count >= 3, GREEN lasts 6 cycles.
  - If less, GREEN lasts 3 cycles.
- *car_detected* input:
  - Increments queue during RED.
  - Decrements queue during GREEN (once per cycle).

## 🧪 Testbenches

| File           | Scenario Simulated                  |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|

## ⚙ Simulation Instructions

### 🧰 Requirements
- [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/)
- [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/)

### 🏃 Steps to Simulate

1. *Compile the design with your chosen testbench:*
   ```bash
   iverilog -o traffic_test smart_traffic_light.v basic_tb.v

2. Run the compiled simulation:
   ```bash
   vvp traffic_test

4. Visualize the output in GTKWave:
   ```
   gtkwave basic_tb.vcd
   ```

Tip: Replace file name basic_tb with emergency_tb or queue_tb; with respective extensions (.v or .vcd) to test other scenarios.
